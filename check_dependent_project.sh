# Ensure that a PR does not introduce downstream breakages on this project's dependents by
# performing checks using this branch's code. If dependents are specified as companions, they are
# patched to use the code we have in this branch; otherwise, we run the the checks against their
# default branch.

# Companion dependents are extracted from the PR's description when lines conform to the following
# formats:
# [cC]ompanion: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/pr_number
# [cC]ompanion: org/repo#pr_number

========================

This check ensures that this project's dependents do not suffer downstream breakages from new code
changes.
